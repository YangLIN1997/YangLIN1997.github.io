I am a third-year DPhil (PhD) student at School of Computer Science, University of Sydney (USYD) and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Data61, under the supervision of Professor Irena Koprinska, and Dr Mashud Rana. I received my B.Eng. degree in 2018 at the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Sydney, supervised by Professor Weidong Xiao. I am fortunate to work a Research Assistant  in 2017 with Professor Georgios Konstantinou, Dr Harith R. Wickramasinghe at University of New South Wales. 
My current focus is on time series forecasting and deep learning.
