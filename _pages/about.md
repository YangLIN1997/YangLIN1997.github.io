I received my B.Eng. degree in 2018 from the School of Electrical & Information Engineering, University of Sydney, supervised by Professor Weidong Xiao. I am fortunate to work a Research Assistant  in 2017 with Professor Georgios Konstantinou, Dr Harith R. Wickramasinghe at University of New South Wales.
